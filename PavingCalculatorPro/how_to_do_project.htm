<ol>
<li>
	Before starting any paving projects, make a layout plan. Plans of the area to be paved should be drawn accurately with detailed dimensions.
</li>
	
<li>
	The quantity of pavers will depend on the way you lay the pavers or style. The paving calculator app will give you accurate calculations. Please include a waste factor to the calculation answers.
</li>
	
<li>
	When determining your finished paved surface height, remember to consider the paving must slope away from the building. Allow for the depth of the road base layer, bedding sand, the paver thickness less plus 10mm for settlement after compaction takes place.
</li>
	
<li>
	Excavate the area to be paved by checking the level and depth of the base by measuring from a string line. The ground level should be even, replace wet patches, loose or soft areas with a sand cement mix or compacted road base.
</li>

<li>
	Spread the road base layer evenly over the project area you have prepared to a depth that you have nominated (default - 100mm or 3 15/16 inches). Then rake to an even thickness before compaction. Compaction of road base is usually performed using a mechanical plate compactor. It is highly recommended that the road base is compacted in 2 - 3 layers, not in one single layer.
</li>

<li>
	Spread and screed a coarse, well graded washed river sand to a depth that you have nominated (default - 30mm or 1 - 3/16 inches). The easiest way to screed sand flat is to use two guides (screeding rails) and a screeding board. Place screeding rails in position so that they slope enough to shed water (check with a spirit level), then spread a layer of bedding sand over the rails. Pull the screeding board over the screeding rails to obtain a uniform depth of approximately. When the sand is screeded remove the guides and back fill in the tracks with bedding sand and smooth off.
</li>

<li>
	Laying pavers to ensure your paving pattern stays in line, set two string lines at right angles to keep the paving joints straight. Allow gaps between paver (default - 2mm to 3mm or 1/16inch to 2/16inch).
</li>

<li>
	After laying all your full-size pavers cutting will be required. The part-size pieces can be measured and cut with hand tools. The best solution is with a diamond blade wet saw.
</li>

<li>
	Edge restraints need to be implemented either with treated pine timber or sand & cement to prevent the pavers from moving horizontally and also restrain the sand and road base.
</li>

<li>
	Once the pavers are laid, sweep dry fine graded sand over the paved area ensuring that all joints are full. This should be continued for a period of time to ensure all gaps are filled.
</li>

<li>
	Compact the pavers using a mechanical plate compactor with a piece of carpet or rubber mat under the compactor to prevent the pavers from being scratched or damaged. After each pass of the compactor sweep in more jointing sand and compact again before sweeping off excess sand.
</li>

<li>
	Complete - Refer to manufactures guide lines for sealing & maintaining pavers.
